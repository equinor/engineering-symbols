## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Engineering Symbols Library**! We welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help improve the library and make it more valuable for engineers, designers, and other technical professionals.

To smoothly add your symbol to our **Engineering symbols**, follow these steps:

1. _Start by utilizing [our plugin](https://github.com/equinor/engineering-symbols-tool-figma). This plugin streamlines the process of adding SVGs._

2. _After exporting your symbol using our plugin, make sure you have an account on MSLA to authorize yourself on the website._

3. _When your SVG is correct and validated, you can use the editor to add connectors and descriptions to your SVG. You can also leverage existing symbols in our library to create new iterations._

4. _Once your symbol is ready, save it as a **Draft**._

5. _Next, submit your SVG for review. One of our administrators will conduct a thorough review and either approve or reject the addition of the symbol._

6. _Upon approval, your symbol will be visible on the [symbol page](./symbols), and you can start using it via the API._

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance during this process.
