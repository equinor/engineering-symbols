# Symbols Library Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the reference implementation of a library for machine-readable symbols designed for use in digital diagrams. Additionally, it includes drafts for an information model to support machine-readable engineering symbols. The project is built using the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: A React framework for building modern web applications.
-   **PullState**: A state management library for React applications.
-   **Styled-components**: CSS-in-JS library for styling components.
-   **MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library)**: Used for authorization and authentication.
-   **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning.
-   **Husky**: Git hooks for enforcing code quality.
-   **Prettier**: Code formatting.
-   **ESLint**: JavaScript linting tool.
-   **GitHub Actions (GHA)**: Used for building and deploying the project.
-   **Release Please**: GitHub Action for automated release management.
-   **Radix**: [Deployment platform](https://console.radix.equinor.com/applications/engineering-symbols/envs).
-   **Docker**: Containerization for deployment.

## Project Structure
