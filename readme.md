# Term clarifications

-   **Symbol library (SL)** - A service for management and offering of versioned collections of engineering symbols.

-   **Engineering symbols (ES)** - Our web-collection of vector-based engineering symbols provides with an extensive range of graphic components that can be used to create professional-grade engineering diagrams and schematics.

-   **Symbol** - Artifact intended to be represent physical engineering objects in digital drawing surfaces and presentation surfaces. It can exist in several collections at once if it contains a different state.

-   **Path** - Element is the most powerful element in the SVG library. Paths create complex shapes by combining multiple straight lines or curved lines.

-   **ViewBox** - Attribute defines the position and dimension, in user space, of an SVG viewport
